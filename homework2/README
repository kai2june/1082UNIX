Works on ubuntu 18.04 and c++17 (g++7.4.0)

monitored library calls=>
minimum requirements ( stat -> __xstat )
reject exec*, system

grading policy=>
1. Use Makefile so that we can use 'make' to build the program.
2. Sandboxed executable work as usual, any directory access not granted will be blocked
I use is_sub_director() in inject.cpp to check whether the access is granted.
3. implement all monitored functions in inject.cpp
4. implement exec* and system in inject.cpp
5. When the directory's permission is not granted, I'll show message on console and return error code
Access not allowed for all function (same for exec* and system)
errno = EACCES
return value : -1

Makefile=>
all:
inject.cpp -> ./sandbox.so
command_launcher.cpp -> ./sandbox
choice.cpp -> ./choice (will be launched by ./sandbox)

clean:
rm ./sandbox.so ./sandbox ./choice
